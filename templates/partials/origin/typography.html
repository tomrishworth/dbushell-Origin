        <p>General typographic styles are global, while others are scoped with <code>.prose</code>, or applied with individual classes like <code>.h1</code> or <code>.p--small</code>. This practice stops style leaking into unexpected areas. See my article <a href="http://dbushell.com/2012/04/18/scoping-typography-css/" target="_blank">Scoping Typography CSS</a>.</p>

        <h4>This is a average headline</h4>
        <h5>This is a small headline</h5>
